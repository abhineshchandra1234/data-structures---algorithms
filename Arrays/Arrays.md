- It has a fixed size
- It stores data of same type
- we cannot insert or delete elements in the array
- We can access elements in `O(1)`
- We can change elements by assigning new value
```
// Initialization
int[] arr = {5,6,1,2,7,9};
int[] arr = new int[size];

int[][] arr = {{1,2,3}, {4,5,6}, {7,8,9}};
int[][] arr = new int[5][6];
```
